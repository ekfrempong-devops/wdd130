        <p>Ghana is a country in West Africa located on the Gulf of Guinea, known for its tropical climate, diverse
            landscape including rainforests and savanna, and rich cultural heritage. As the first sub-Saharan nation to gain
            independence from colonial rule in 1957, it has evolved into a multi-party democracy with a growing economy, primarily driven
            by natural resources like gold, cocoa, and oil. The capital is Accra, and the country is characterized by its warm,
            welcoming population and vibrant cultural scene</p>
