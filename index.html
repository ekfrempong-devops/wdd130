        <p>My name is Emmanuel Kwasi Frempong. I am a proud Ghanaian and I hold a bachelor’s degree in Natural Resource
            Management. I have
            over five
            years of combined experience in hospitality and FMCG sales, with strong skills in client relationship
            management, sales
            growth, and premium brand visibility. Beyond this, I am deeply passionate about cybersecurity and software
            engineering,
            and I am actively building my expertise in these fields to create innovative solutions and protect digital
            systems. I am
            committed to personal growth, faith, and resilience, with a vision of building a meaningful career that
